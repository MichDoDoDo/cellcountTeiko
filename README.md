## Code Base Structure:
The project uses a modular design that separates database logic (db/), data analysis and I/O operations (src/), and user interface components (gui/views/). The Tkinter GUI is structured as a multi-page application with reusable views and tabbed navigation, making it easy to scale with new analytical features or database extensions.
This design was chosen to ensure clarity, maintainability, and future scalabilityâ€”allowing scientists and developers to easily expand the application with minimal coupling between components.
